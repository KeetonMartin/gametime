### Things to look into
ESPN has player stats for each game:
sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/seasons/{YEAR}/athletes/{ATHLETE_ID}/eventlog
https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/seasons/2022/athletes/14876/eventlog
Sleeper API I think returns the ESPN id of each player
